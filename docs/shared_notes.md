# Lerke — Shared Session Notes

## How to use this file

This is the **living collaborative log** for the Lerke project — shared between Atle (Johimja) and Claude.

- **Read this at the start of every session** (after `docs/recentmemory.txt`)
- **Add a session entry** when starting or ending a work session
- **Check off roadmap items** as they're completed
- **CONTEXT EFFICIENCY:** Do not overfill the context window. Use grep/glob, read only relevant parts of files.
- This file is version-controlled — always in sync with the code

Reading order for a cold start:
1. `docs/recentmemory.txt` — quick project orientation
2. **This file** — decisions, session history, roadmap
3. `README.md` — full project docs

## Project Identity

**Lerke** is a classroom game portal built for Steinerskolen i Kristiansand, Norway.
Built by Atle Stray (Johimja) with Claude (Anthropic), hosted on GitHub Pages at `johimja.com/Lerke`.
Plain HTML/CSS/JS frontend, Supabase backend (auth + realtime + PostgreSQL).

Current live tool: **Lerke Bingo** (teacher-led live bingo with student join).
Next tool planned: **Lerke Quiz** (after Bingo is stable).

### 2026-04-16 — Session 15: Day/night mode toggle across all pages

**What was shipped:**
- All 4 HTML pages (`index.html`, `apps/bingo/teacher.html`, `apps/bingo/student.html`, `apps/bingo-generator/index.html`) now have a 🌙/☀️ toggle button fixed in the lower-left corner.
- Theme follows system `prefers-color-scheme` on first visit; manual toggle persists in `localStorage` (`lerke-theme`) and carries across all pages.
- `index.html`: Dark/night theme uses a deep plum palette (`#15101f`–`#1a1428` backgrounds, `#1e1630` panels, `#e8e2f2` text, subtle purple borders). Accent colours (plum, green, gold) are unchanged. Hardcoded warm-paper backgrounds overridden via `[data-theme="dark"]` selectors.
- `teacher.html`, `student.html`, `bingo-generator/index.html`: These were already dark. New light/day mode uses the index.html warm-paper palette (`--bg:#f8f2e8`, panels `#fffaf2`). Live game modals and credential boxes intentionally remain dark in both modes.
- Theme init script sits in `<head>` (synchronous, after `<style>`) to avoid flash of unstyled content. Toggle JS added before `</body>`.
- Branch: `claude/add-night-mode-toggle-wsngP` — PR pending merge.

### 2026-04-16 — Session 14: Student email/password login path

**What was shipped:**
- `index.html`: Added "Logg inn med e-post i stedet" toggle link below the student login_code + PIN form. Clicking it swaps to an email+password form (`student-login-email-form`). `portalStudentLoginEmail()` calls `supabaseClient.auth.signInWithPassword`; existing `refreshPortalAuthState` then calls `get_current_student_profile` to hydrate `currentStudentProfile`. If the email isn't linked to any student account, the session is signed out and the user gets a clear error. Toggle link in the email form goes back to code login.
- This closes the ⚠️ known limitation from Session 13 — email association is now a usable login path.

**Next task:** Phase out anonymous join (Tier 1) — require login for all students joining Bingo.

---

### 2026-04-16 — Session 13: Single-code login, speed podium, email association, glose generator, LM Studio

**What was shipped:**

**Speed Podium:**
- `apps/bingo/teacher.html`: End-of-round Speed Podium in the bingo celebration overlay — top 3 fastest responders from `speed_leaderboard` data already in the RPC. Icons ⚡/🔥/💨 with average time display.

**Single-code student login (V11):**
- `supabase/sql/supabase_bingo_v11_student_login_code.sql` (applied ✅): Adds `login_code` (6-char, globally unique) to `student_profiles`. Backfills all existing students. New RPCs: `student_login_with_code(p_login_code, p_pin)` replaces 3-field login; `student_change_pin(p_current_pin, p_new_pin)` for self-service PIN changes.
- `index.html`: Student login form simplified from **3 fields** (class code + student code + PIN) to **2 fields** (login_code + PIN). Teacher student list shows `login_code` prominently. "Bytt PIN" section added to student session card. Fixed `ensurePortalStudentSession` to not sign out email-linked student sessions.
- `apps/bingo/student.html`: Account meta now shows login_code instead of class+student codes.

**Email/password association:**
- `index.html`: Logged-in students can optionally link an email + password to their account via the portal. If already linked, the option is hidden and replaced with a password-reset form. Students who forget their email password can log in with login_code + PIN and reset from there. All done via Supabase SDK `updateUser` (no extra SQL).
- ⚠️ **Known limitation:** The email/password credentials are linked in Supabase Auth, but the portal does **not yet have a login form for students to use email+password**. Currently students can only enter via login_code + PIN. Email was added as a future upgrade path — the portal login flow still needs an "or log in with email" branch to make it usable. Add this before broadly advertising the feature.

**Glose generator (`apps/bingo-generator/index.html`):**
- Added full "⚡ Generer gloser" sidebar section with:
  - **Language dropdowns** — source and target language, 10 languages each (Norsk, Engelsk, Tysk, Spansk, Fransk, Italiensk, Portugisisk, Arabisk, Kinesisk, Japansk).
  - **Word-translate tab** — teacher types/pastes individual words, each gets translated via MyMemory free API (no key needed, no account, CORS-friendly: `api.mymemory.translated.net`). 250ms delay between calls to respect rate limits.
  - **Text-extract tab** — teacher pastes a full text; system extracts candidate words (4–18 chars, filtered against 100+ stop words across 6 languages), then either:
    - Sends to **MyMemory** for free translation word-by-word, or
    - Sends full text + word-count setting to an **LLM** that returns word pairs as JSON.
  - **Word count slider** — 3 to 30 pairs.
  - **Mode toggle** — "Til Norsk" / "Fra Norsk" (direction clarified).
  - Pairs are previewed and individually removable before being added to the active word list with duplicate detection.

**LLM providers for glose generation:**
Three providers selectable in a dropdown:
1. **MyMemory (free)** — no key, rate-limited, word-by-word.
2. **Anthropic (Claude Haiku)** — API key saved to `localStorage` in teacher's own browser. Routed via Supabase edge function `generate-glose` (deployed ✅ with `verify_jwt: false`). Model: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`.
3. **OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini)** — same as Anthropic, different endpoint. Both cloud keys are **never stored in Lerke's DB** — localStorage only, teacher pays their own bill.
4. **LM Studio (lokal)** — calls `http://localhost:1234` directly from the browser. Bypasses edge function entirely. Teacher can change the URL if port differs. "Hent modeller" button fetches available models via `GET /v1/models` and populates a select.

**LM Studio — settings the teacher must configure:**
> These settings are in LM Studio → Developer → Local Server → Server Settings:
> - **Enable CORS** ✅ — must be ON (browser sends cross-origin requests from `https://johimja.com`)
> - **Server Port** — default 1234. If changed, teacher must update the URL field in the glose generator.
> - **Serve on Local Network** — OFF is fine for the teacher's own machine. Turn ON if the school network should reach LM Studio from another device (e.g., teacher laptop → classroom display). Note: this does NOT help students reach it from their own devices unless all are on the same LAN and CORS + firewall allow it.
> - **Require Authentication** — leave OFF unless you know what you're doing (adding auth tokens would require extra UI in the generator).
> - LM Studio must have a model loaded and in READY state before generation works.

### 2026-04-16 — Session 12: Teacher live mode crash fixes (full restore)

**Background:** A previous Gemini edit attempt introduced several fatal bugs into `teacher.html`. Several HTML elements were also deleted. The teacher live screen was completely broken.

**Root causes found and fixed:**

1. **`renderLiveMode` crashed when modal was closed** — `refreshTeacherLiveState()` calls `renderLiveMode()` directly, which ran before `openLiveMode()` showed the modal. `getElementById('live-kicker')` returned null → crash.
   - **Fix:** Guard at top of `renderLiveMode`: return early if `#live-modal` doesn't have class `'show'`.

2. **`resumeActiveSession` read non-existent `rounds_data`** — Gemini added code reading `teacherLiveState.session.rounds_data` which doesn't exist in the `get_bingo_live_state` API response. `liveRounds` was never populated on page reload.
   - **Fix:** Removed the reference. Reads `game_mode` from `settings` instead to set `liveLabel`.

3. **`drawIndexReachedRoundEnd` returned true when `totalDraws = 0`** — With empty `liveRounds` (recovery mode), `totalDraws = 0`, making `draw_index >= 0` always true. This caused "Fullfør runde" to show prematurely and `complete_bingo_round` to fire on the first button click.
   - **Fix:** Return `false` when `totalDraws <= 0` (unknown/recovery) — never prematurely end a round.

4. **`openLiveMode` button stuck as "Neste"** — HTML default for `#live-next-draw` is "Neste". In recovery mode `teacherLiveState` was already set before `openLiveMode`, so the pre-populate guard (`!teacherLiveState?.state`) skipped the correction.
   - **Fix:** Always pre-set button to "Åpne trekk" (strict render corrects it within 250ms).

5. **Missing HTML elements** — `live-round-label` and `live-answer` were deleted from the live modal HTML. Both are referenced extensively in JS render functions → TypeError on every render tick.
   - **Fix:** Restored both elements between the join-wrap and `live-stage`.

6. **Invisible text** — `live-title` and `live-answer` were `color:var(--muted)` (#7c8099) on a `#141926` background — near-zero contrast.
   - **Fix:** `live-title` → `#9bacc7`, `live-answer` → `#8c94b3`.

7. **`getTeacherRoundDrawTotal` always returned 0 in recovery** — `liveRounds` is empty on reload.
   - **Fix:** Falls back to `settings.draws_per_round` (new field stored in session settings on creation).

8. **`draws_per_round` not stored** — New sessions now include `draws_per_round` in the `settings` JSONB so recovery mode can display correct draw totals.

**Result:** Teacher live mode is fully functional. Confirmed working: "ÅPNE TREKK" → countdown → "LÅS TREKK (11)" → history builds → "RUNDE 1 AV 3" visible. ✅

### 2026-04-15 — Session 11: Authentication, account management, teacher UI polish

**What was shipped:**
- `apps/bingo/student.html`: "Logg inn med elevkode" link, "Bytt bruker" link, `signOutStudent()` and `escapeHtml()`.
- `apps/bingo/teacher.html`: Restored large glowing join code, auto-collapse join box on first draw, Live Ticker with 20+ gamified messages, larger countdown timer when join box is collapsed.
- `supabase/sql/supabase_bingo_v8_reactions_speed.sql`: `draw_reactions` table, `send_bingo_reaction` (fixed wrong column `user_id` → `auth_user_id`), `get_draw_reactions`, `touch_session_heartbeat`, `get_bingo_live_state` updated with `fastest_participant`, `speed_leaderboard`, `host_active`.

---

### 2026-04-15 — Session 10: Near-bingo alert + student manual controls removed

**What was shipped:**
- `apps/bingo/teacher.html`: Near-bingo alert — Elevoversikt highlights students who need 1 more correct answer; `⚡ 1 til!` badge and orange border on their row; alert banner lists their names.
- `apps/bingo/student.html`: Removed "Tøm" and "Nytt kort" buttons; teacher manages rounds in strict live mode.
